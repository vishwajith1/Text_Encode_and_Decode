# Text_Encode_and_Decode
Rail Fence Cipher

This project/ implementation might not be the best way, 
My aim was to implement a readable and easy to understand mathmetical manipulation approch of Rail Fence Cypher.

Project structure:

1. All the code is in single c file named rcypher.c.
2. program reads the message in plain.txt and file encrypts it.
3. The Encrypted is stored in EncryptedResult.txt file.
4. For deryption of ciphertext, data is read from the file EncryptedResult.txt.
   and the resulting plaintext is printed on the screen and also creates and stores in text file called DecryptedText.txt.
